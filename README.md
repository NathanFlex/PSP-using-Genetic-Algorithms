# PSP-using-Genetic-Algorithms

## Summary
This repository consists of the codes and methodology used to create an algorithm to predict stable configurations of proteins in the cartesian plane. By exploring different approaches to mutation and crossover, we developed a predictive model capable of suggesting 2D HP structures given a protein sequence.
